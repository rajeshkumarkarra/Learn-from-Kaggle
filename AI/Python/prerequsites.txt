Prerequisites and Prework 
Prerequisites

Machine Learning Crash Course does not presume or require any prior knowledge in machine learning. However, to understand the concepts presented and complete the exercises, we recommend that students meet the following prerequisites:

    Mastery of intro-level algebra. You should be comfortable with variables and coefficients, linear equations, graphs of functions, and histograms. (Familiarity with more advanced math concepts such as logarithms and derivatives is helpful, but not required.)

    Proficiency in programming basics, and some experience coding in Python. Programming exercises in Machine Learning Crash Course are coded in Python using TensorFlow. No prior experience with TensorFlow is required, but you should feel comfortable reading and writing Python code that contains basic programming constructs, such as function definitions/invocations, lists and dicts, loops, and conditional expressions.
Prework

Programming exercises run directly in your browser (no setup required!) using the Colaboratory platform. Colaboratory is supported on most major browsers, and is most thoroughly tested on desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox. If you'd prefer to download and run the exercises offline, see these instructions for setting up a local environment.
Problem Framing

If you're new to machine learning, we recommend starting your journey by taking Introduction to Machine Learning Problem Framing. This one-hour course teaches you how to identify appropriate problems for machine learning.
Getting Started with pandas

The programming exercises in Machine Learning Crash Course use the pandas library for manipulating data sets. If you're unfamiliar with pandas, we recommend completing the Quick Introduction to pandas tutorial, which illustrates the key pandas features used in the exercises.
Key Concepts and Tools

Machine Learning Crash Course discusses and applies the following concepts and tools. For more information, see the linked resources.
